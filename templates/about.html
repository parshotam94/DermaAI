    <h1>Basic Structure of Skin</h1>
<p>The skin is the largest organ of the human body and serves as a protective barrier. It has three main layers, each with distinct functions:</p>

<h3>1. Epidermis (Outer Layer)</h3>

<strong>Thickness</strong>: 0.05–1.5 mm (varies by body part)
<br>
<strong>Composition:</strong>
<br>
 Mainly made of keratinocytes, with melanocytes (pigment-producing cells), Langerhans cells (immune), and Merkel cells (touch receptors).
<br>
<strong>Functions:</strong>
<br>
Protects against environmental hazards (UV, pathogens)

Prevents water loss

Gives skin its color (melanin)

Sub-layers (from bottom to top):

Stratum basale (basal layer) → cell division occurs

Stratum spinosum → provides strength

Stratum granulosum → produces keratin

Stratum lucidum → only in thick skin (palms/soles)

Stratum corneum → dead cells, forms protective barrier
<br>
<h3>2. Dermis (Middle Layer)</h3>
<br>
<strong>Thickness:</strong> 0.3–4 mm
<br>
<strong>Composition:</strong> 
<br>
Connective tissue, collagen, elastin, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands
<br>
<strong>Functions:</strong>
<br>
Provides strength and elasticity

Supports epidermis with nutrients (via blood supply)

Houses sensory receptors (touch, pain, temperature)

Thermoregulation via sweat and blood flow
<br>
<h3>3. Hypodermis / Subcutaneous Layer (Deepest Layer)</h3>
<br>
<strong>Composition:</strong> Mainly fat and connective tissue
<br>
<strong>Functions:<strong>
<br>
Insulates the body

Cushions internal organs

Stores energy

Anchors skin to underlying muscles and bones

<h1>Skin Diseases and Precautions</h1>
<br>
        <h2>What Are Skin Diseases?</h2><br>
        <p>Skin diseases are medical conditions that affect the skin, hair, or nails. They can be caused by infections, allergies, genetics, immune disorders, environmental factors, or lifestyle. Skin diseases can range from mild irritations like rashes to serious conditions like skin cancer.</p>
</p>

 <h3>Common Types of Skin Diseases:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infections:</strong> Bacterial (impetigo), viral (shingles, cold sores), fungal (athlete’s foot, ringworm)</li>
            <li><strong>Inflammatory:</strong> Eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, hives</li>
            <li><strong>Pigmentation Disorders:</strong> Vitiligo, melasma</li>
            <li><strong>Growths:</strong> Warts, moles, skin tags</li>
            <li><strong>Acne and Pimples</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Precautions to Protect Skin Health</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain Cleanliness:</strong> Wash skin regularly and avoid touching face with dirty hands.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Harsh Chemicals:</strong> Use mild, non-comedogenic skincare products.</li>
            <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Apply sunscreen, wear hats and protective clothing.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Diet:</strong> Eat foods rich in vitamins A, C, E and drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Excessive Scratching:</strong> Scratching can worsen rashes or infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Stress can trigger acne and eczema. Practice meditation or exercise.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Checkups:</strong> Visit a dermatologist for persistent issues and monitor moles.</li>
            <li><strong>Hygienic Lifestyle:</strong> Change towels and bedsheets regularly, keep nails trimmed.</li>
